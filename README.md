# Task2-of-ApexPlanet
### ðŸ”¹ **Task 2 â€“ Intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

In this task, I enhanced my foundational skills by working with **forms, validation, responsive layouts, and DOM manipulation**.

---

### âœ… **1. Contact Form with HTML & CSS**

* Created a **form** containing input fields like **Name, Email, and Submit button**.
* Used **HTML5 attributes** such as `required` and `type="email"` for basic validation.
* Styled the form with **CSS** by applying:

  * Colors, fonts, and spacing.
  * Rounded corners with `border-radius`.
  * Shadows using `box-shadow` for a modern UI.
  * Button hover effects for interactivity.

This taught me how to **collect user input** and style form elements professionally.

---

### âœ… **2. JavaScript Form Validation**

* Wrote a **JavaScript function** to handle the form `submit` event.
* Used a **regular expression (Regex)** to validate the email format:

  ```javascript
  let emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  ```
* Added **conditions** to:

  * Check if required fields are empty.
  * Ensure a valid email is entered.
  * Show an **alert message** based on success or errors.

This gave me hands-on practice in **event handling** and **form validation logic**.

---

### âœ… **3. Responsive Layout (Flexbox + Grid + Media Queries)**

* Designed the webpage structure using a **navigation bar, main content area, and sidebar**.
* Applied **Flexbox** in the navigation bar for alignment and spacing.
* Applied **CSS Grid** in the content section:

  * Divided the page into **2 columns** (Main content + Sidebar).
  * Automatically adjusted layout with **media queries** for smaller screens (mobile/tablet).

This showed me how to build **modern, responsive web designs** that adapt to different devices.

---

### âœ… **4. To-Do List with DOM Manipulation**

* Created a **To-Do List app** inside the sidebar.
* Allowed users to **add tasks dynamically** by typing into an input field and clicking a button.
* Used **JavaScript DOM methods** like:

  * `document.createElement()` to create new list items.
  * `appendChild()` to add tasks into the list.
  * `remove()` to delete tasks when the delete button (`X`) is clicked.

This helped me understand **DOM manipulation**, **dynamic elements**, and **event-driven programming**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Skills Learned in Task 2**

* Structuring forms and layouts with **HTML**.
* Styling components and building responsiveness with **CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)**.
* Validating user input and handling events with **JavaScript**.
* Manipulating the **DOM** to add/remove content dynamically.


ðŸ‘‰ Overall, Task 2 gave me a strong foundation in **real-world web development skills** by combining structure, design, interactivity, and responsiveness into one complete project.
